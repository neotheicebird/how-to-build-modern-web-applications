# What can you expect from this talk?

### What kind of problems can we solve using web Applications?

### How were web applications made in the past?

### How are they made nowadays?

### How you can start developing one today!

# What are web applications?

Let's create a conceptual understanding:-


- An ✨Application✨ is a type of software

- Helps humans achieve a task ✔️

- Reduce human effort

- Can create new Possibilies and Expand human consciousness 🌌

<!--note 
Take for example an app like Facebook. It has connected human beings across the world and this improved communications has fundamentally changed how we look at life.

# What are web applications?

<!-- fragments-start -->
A ✨Web Application✨ is an application that is accessible "online"

It has atleast two components, a client and a web server

client handles human interactions

A server protects and handles business logic

Client and Server use Web Protocols to communicate

# Web Applications: Examples 📱

- Travel: Ola, Metro Train App

- Communication: Whatsapp, Discord, Zoom

- Food: Swiggy, Big Basket

- Shopping: Amazon, Myntra

<!-- note
Not just consumer apps, there are enterprise apps which are used by employees to help them work better.

# But how did we get so good at making them?

- Years of created assets, documented best practises and ever bubbling community
- Its a long standing experiment
- The industry has mutated and better traits emerge as trends
- Open Source Culture 💖

<!-- note
But how did we get so good at making them?

Like any other discipline, through years of practise and by making multiple iterations, the craft of making web apps is now at a peak never before.

Right now, So much of that wealth of decades of work is available for us to use and realize so many of our ideas!

# Key aspects of apps made in the past?

- Dynamic, on the fly HTML
- Usage of a variety of databases
- 🤹🏻‍♂️ Complex systems that solved many problems
- like skyscrappers, Vertically structured
- Deeply coupled features 🙀

<!-- note
While it would take long to explore the entire history of software development, lets try to understand the last generation and its downsides before we understand where we stand now.

# Some Problems solved by web servers

- Properly route and parse requests
- Data Storage
- Authentication and Authorization
- Scheduling and Backend Tasks
- Server static assets and frontend code

---
# Some issues with the past architectures

- Improper Segregation of Responsibilites = More Bugs, Harder Maintenance
- Single Point of Failure
- Difficult to Scale
- Bigger bills and lesser fuel for creativity
